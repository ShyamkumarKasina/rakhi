        <h2>About Raksha Bandhan</h2>
        <p>Raksha Bandhan, also known as Rakhi, is a popular Hindu festival that celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. It is observed on the full moon day of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana, which usually falls in August.</p>
        <p>On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called Rakhi around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and prayers for their brothers' well-being and protection. In return, brothers give gifts and promise to protect their sisters throughout their lives.</p>
        <p>The festival is marked by various rituals, traditional sweets, and the exchange of gifts. It strengthens the bond of love and affection between siblings and is a reminder of the responsibilities they share towards each other.</p>

			<p>We help them embark on a journey of finding their true selves by organizing events that discuss women's issues with the help of women who share their experiences. Our events are a mix of girl talk and fun. There are also signature events that happen every year such as #UnWined, Heels Class for a Cure, and Improv Yourself. These signature events are led by a guest speaker who has had a breakthrough in the presented topic. She'll speak about her personal experiences followed by hands-on games, activities, and open conversations. And of course, there's wine and delicious appetizers.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to encourage and motivate the everyday woman by giving her the tools to overcome everyday challenges and meet women who have faced and overcome the same challenges. By helping one another, women can transform not only our peers but the world.</p>
